# LangChain with Hugging Face Demo

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to use [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) with models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) to build LLM-powered applications.

 Environment Setup

The notebook installs and configures the following libraries:
- `langchain`
- `langchain_community`
- `huggingface_hub`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `bitsandbytes`

Hugging Face API tokens are used to authenticate with Hugging Face Hub.

 Features Demonstrated

1. **Basic LLM Interaction**
- Loaded the `google/flan-t5-large` model using `HuggingFaceHub`.
- Ran a translation prompt and a cuisine-based restaurant name generation.

2. **Prompt Engineering with Templates**
- Created reusable `PromptTemplate`s for:
  - Generating restaurant names
  - Suggesting menu items based on cuisine and restaurant name

3. **Chaining LLMs**
- Built chains using `LLMChain` and `SimpleSequentialChain` to:
  - Generate company names based on product types
  - Generate restaurant names and then corresponding menu items

4. **LangChain + Hugging Face Tasks**
- Suggested company names for a given product.
- Retrieved details about a famous football player using their name.

Summary

This notebook showcases key LangChain features:
- LLM initialization
- Prompt engineering
- Chain creation
- Hugging Face integration

It serves as a practical introduction to building LLM-powered applications using LangChain.
